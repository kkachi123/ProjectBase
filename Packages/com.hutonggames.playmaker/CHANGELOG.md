- Fixed Stopwatch meter in **Shooting Gallery Sample**.

## [2.0.0 beta 66] - 2026-5-8

### Changed

- Improved transition and logging performance. This is actually fairly invasive, so please report any issues you encounter.
- Restored icon, name, and description editing in FSM Inspector.
- Changed **CharacterControllerJump** to output a jump velocity that you then use in "In Air" actions like **CharacterControllerMoveInAir**. This fixes hitches in the hand-off between Jump and other movement actions.
- Tweaked Jump scenes in **First Person Samples** to better handle falling and ramps.
- Moved Require Raycast Hit from actions to the Interactable component – it's part of the setup of an interactable object.
- Converted ButtonDoor buttons in **First Person Samples** to use Interactables.
- Only dim PlayMaker hierarchy icon if all FSMs on the GameObject are disabled.

### Added

- Added root canvas menu to make it easier to add a second FSM and select FSMs on a GameObject.
- Added **CharacterControllerMoveOnGround** action that applies downward velocity to stick to ramps etc.
- Added **FloatSelectValue**, **IntegerSelectValue**, etc. to select a value based on a Bool. They're conceptually similar to ConvertBoolToFloat etc. but with that emphasis on the target type.
- Added DebugInfo to **PhysicsCheckCollider** action.
- Added PressurePlateDoor scene to **First Person Samples**.
- Added logging tools to PlayMaker/Tools. If you have many FSMs updating often, you can disable logging on them to improve performance. The trade-off is the FSM Log and Debug Flow will not work on those FSMs. NOTE: Logging is always off in builds.
- Added a separate Enable Variable History setting in the Debug settings. Recording variable history can be expensive. The trade-off is that you won't see old variable values as you step Prev/Next states using Debug Flow.

### Fixed

- Fixed infinite loop checking in **Loop State** action with Forever setting.
- Fixed **ListFind** error with GameObjectList and Name tests.
- Fixed random null ref error when editing prefabs.
- Fixed Global variables losing type information.

### Added

- Added foldout to FSM Component inspector so you can collapse details.
- Added PerSecond, CanFinish, and FinishDistance to make all MoveTowards actions consistent. You can ignore FinishDistance by setting it to -1. You may need to set this in actions that previously used to run forever.
- Added [Interactable](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/guides/interactables/) component and **actions**. Use the [Interactables](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/guides/interactables/) system to manage interactions: set up interactions, select valid interactions, trigger interaction events, and end the interaction.
- Added UseInteractable scene and tweaked Elevator scene in **First Person** samples to show how to use Interactables.
- Added CharacterController actions: **ApplyGravity**, **ApplyPlatformMotion**, **Climb**, and **CheckIsGrounded** variants.
- Added MovingPlatforms, ClimbLadder, and ClimbWall scenes to **First Person** samples.
- Added Smooth Time to **Rigidbody** and **Rigidbody2D MoveTowards** actions.

- Reset Action Browser search when opening instead of remembering last search.
- Tweaked Action Browser search to handle mixed space queries.
- Global Event in Events tab now shows usages in that FSM instead of all usages.

- Moved Update Inputs Every Frame setting from action Update Mode to the Inputs header, e.g., in **RunTemplate**.
- Consistency pass on Physics cast actions so they all have the same core parameters.
- Support asset relative paths in [EnumDefinitions](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/components/enum-definition/) output folder.

- Cleaner formatting of search results.
- Added **Show Preview** option in settings menu.
- Improved **Recent** and **Favorites** management.

### Added

- [DataDefinitions](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/components/data-definition/) and [DataTables](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/components/data-tables/). See **DataTables Sample**.

## [2.0.0 beta 51] - 2025-12-5

### Added

- **InputActionMap** and **InputActionAsset** actions for new [Input System](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/actions/input-system-actions/).
- **InputActionReadFloatValueSmooth** action that smooths the value.

- Use **Alt+Up/Down** to move selected items up/down in editor list views (e.g. Actions List).

### Changed

- **InputAction** actions now use **InputActionReference** instead of **InputActionProperty**. This means no inline InputActions (Unity has moved away from inline InputActions). You will need to re-assign InputAction references in existing projects.
- **InputAction** actions no longer auto-enable the action. Instead, use **InputActionMapEnable** or **InputActionAssetEnable** actions.
- Changed **ParticleSystem** action namespace. You will need to replace ParticleSystem actions in existing projects. If you have many, you can search/replace in scene/prefab files: `HutongGames.PlayMaker.Actions.ParticleSystem` -> `HutongGames.PlayMaker.Actions`
- Added World/Local Space option to **RigidbodySetVelocity** actions.

### Fixed

- Fixed mouse system events (OnMouseDown etc.) when only the new Input System is installed.

## [2.0.0 beta 50] - 2025-11-30

### Added

- [Buffered Input actions](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/actions/input-actions/buffered-input/) for jump buffering, coyote time, input chords, etc.
- Added missing WheelCollider Friction actions.

### Changes

- Added browse button and variable links for [Get/Set FSM Variable](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/actions/state-machine-actions/get-fsm-variable/) actions.
  NOTE: This requires new data. Old data is migrated in this release but will eventually be removed.
- Made common legacy input actions work with the new input system (e.g., all keyboard and mouse actions, and button and axis actions with default Input Manager names)
- Most Device actions (e.g., Accelerometer, HumiditySensor, etc.) now use `[device].current` and no longer have variables. 99.9% of devices have only one sensor.
- Changed Gamepad actions to use Gamepad Index. Removed Gamepad variables. Added a few utility actions.
- Tweaked MouseLook sensitivity. Exposed inputs in First Person samples.

### Fixed

- Performance: Fixed editor performance issues in beta 49.

- Lander game sample. Simple Lunar Lander game.

### Changes

- Events are now processed [bottom up](docs:actions/event-actions/#hierarchical-event-flow) (deepest active sub-state -> root). This is pretty standard for hierarchical FSMs, but it might result in subtle changes in your existing FSMs.
- Graph View: Added a turn-cost to Node links. Circuit links in particular should behave better.
- Action Editor: Changed "playing" icon back to a green-tinted toggle (like PM1).
- Hierarchy Icon is dimmed if FSM Component is disabled.
- Graph View: Made Minimap opaque.

### Actions

- Removed **Keep Largest Region** from Procedural Generators. Use [Filter](action:FilterCellsKeepLargestRegions) instead.
- Added Procedural Generation Filter actions.
- Added **Keep Existing** to BuildRandomRects action. For example, to seed the list with a Start Room and an End Room with other rooms generated around them.
- Added ListSum and AddMultiple actions for float, integer, Vector2 and Vector3 variables.
- Added Tilemap Snapshot actions for saving/restoring tilemaps.
- Added BoundsInt addon.

- Ctrl+Click **Add Global Event/Variable** buttons to open browsers.
- Changed Variable Toggle selected icon. Was an X to indicate "Click to remove variable," but it was confusing when used in a list view (it could mean remove the list item).
- Don't remove variable references when hidden in the UI. Instead, the usage finder will show that the usage is hidden.
- Tweaked Group title size.

### Fixed

- Fixed drag and dropping multiple items into list parameters in an Action.
- Fixed parsing errors in EvaluateBooleanExpression action.
- Fixed UI hitches in Icon Popup. Time-slice loading icons.
- Fixed exception when trying to set a Vector3 variable assigned to a Vector2 field.
- Fixed very long strings (and UI warnings) when debugging list variables. String is truncated now with "+ x more items" at the end.

- Unifying pass on **TransformLookAt** and **TransformMoveTowards** actions:
  - Added **SmoothTime** and **MaxSpeed** to all LookAt and MoveTowards actions.
  - Added **Facing Axis** and **RotationConstraint** to Lookat actions. You might need to set the facing axis again, Z (Forward) for a regular 3D look at.

- Better Acronym matches in search (e.g., t2 finds Texture2D, ue finds UnityEvent).
- Highlight search matches in variable type selector.
- API: Added OnStateEnter and OnStateExit to BaseAction.
- API: Removed OnInitialize from BaseAction.

### Removed

- Removed actions that used undocumented Unity code:

### Changed

- Allow sending Finished event in SendEvent.
- Send Finished event in ListGetNextItem if list is empty.
- Resized pickable node Icons to 64 x 64. They were 128 x 128 to support using them as larger images on the canvas, but 64 x 64 is probably fine.

### Added

- Added First Person Shooting samples.
- Added Spawning samples.
- Added more GettingStarted samples (LoopNextItem, WaitActions).
- Added custom KeyCode popup (instead of the long enum menu).
- Added "Open in new FSM Editor" context menu item in the Finder window. The FSM Component needs to be loaded to see it (not in an unloaded scene).

- Simplified StringEquals to be consistent with other Equals actions. Use CheckStringEquals for True/False events.

### Added

- Added more Getting Started samples.
- Added Sent By section to Transition Inspector. Use this to store sent by information from the event.

- Finished ShootingGallery game sample. It's a good demo for a lot of simple game systems.
- Text-only comment items in list views are slightly dimmed to reduce visual clutter. A comment is considered text-only if it does not start with '#' (a Markdown header). Markdown is not dimmed because we assume the information is more important.

### Added

- Added TweenTransform actions.
- Added TransformGetLocalPosition2D and TransformMoveTowardsLocalPosition actions.
- Added Input/Output support to more list variable types.

### Fixed

- Fixed assigning converted Global Variables in actions.
- Fixed event usages not found in global transitions. Fixes used count and copy/paste.

- Fixed the empty hint in the graph view to open the prefab when selecting a prefab in the project view.

## [2.0.0 beta 38] - 2025-09-02

### Changed

- API: Changed the BaseVariableProperty signature. If you made any custom variable property types, you need to add the variable data type as a generic parameter.  
For example: `public class FloatIsNegativeVariable : BaseVariableProperty<float, bool>`
- Reorganized samples. Split Core Samples into separate packages for easier searching and updating.

### Added

- Added Enabled toggle on regions in Region Inspector. Use this to enable/disable regions while testing.
- Added Component to Transform conversion, so you can select Component variables in Transform actions.
- Added Goto Parent Group button and Child Groups list to Group Inspector.
- Added Enum actions: Get/Set FSM Enum, Enum Equals and Enum Check Equals.
- Added Prev/Next buttons and shortcuts to Usage finder windows.
- Added PlayMaker/Documentation asset. Use Markdown to document your project.
- Added AnimatorSetTriggerRepeated action.

### Fixed

- Fixed entering negative numbers in Quaternion fields.
- Fixed Tween UI not updating after adding/removing blocks.
- Fixed image aspect ratios not adapting to layout in Markdown render.
- Fixed accessing global variable properties in Variable Selector.
- Fixed finding Global Events and Variable usages in the Finder.
- Fixed the Alt key sometimes getting stuck in the Graph View (it would act like you were alt-dragging).
- Fixed broken editor UI if an action editor throws an exception. Instead, it shows an error box and gives you options to fix the problem.
- Verify update mode when converting actions (sometimes the new action needs a different update mode).

## [2.0.0 beta 37] - 2025-08-25

### Changed

- Added Markdown support in more places:
  - State and node descriptions.
  - Comment nodes and list items. 
  - Removed separate Notes node and list item. Use Comments instead.
  - Removed Icon control from comment nodes and list items. Use Markdown instead. I debated this, but the duplication didn't make sense. It's a little more work to add an icon in Markdown, but a lot more flexible. And hopefully, the Markdown editor will evolve over time.
  - NOTE: Markdown formatting is a little different from plain text, so you may need to reformat existing comments (e.g. paragraph breaks).
- Improved navigation and focus handling in the Finder window.
- Incremented the database version. You may see a console message about updating the database.
- Renamed System Events: InputSystem category to UI Events because the events are not specific to the new Input System.
- Removed duplicate GameObjectGetIsActive and GameObjectGetIsActiveInHierarchy actions. Use GameObjectGetActiveSelf and GameObjectGetActiveInHierarchy instead.
- Renamed Mathf GetClamp actions to GetClamped.

### Added

- Added new sample games: PinWheel based on the "aa" mobile game and BlockDodger. These are good samples to get started—simple but still doing some interesting stuff.
- Added Add Global buttons to Events and Variables inspectors.
- Added Open Prefab button to Selection Toolbar when editing a prefab instance.
- Added prev/next error buttons to Debug Toolbar.
- Added Usages section to Addons Preview. Currently shows used actions.
- Added Samples section to Action Browser Preview. Shows if the action is used in any samples.
- Added ConvertEnumToInteger action and intValue property to convert enums to an int value.
- Alt-clicking a group foldout opens/closes all groups in the list.

- Added Float Variable Negate property.
- Added Integer variable properties.

### Fixed

- Better handling of prefab overrides in the editor.

- Fixed ugly undo labels with cryptic property paths. If you still see any, please post on the forums.
- Fixed some light theme styles (watch variable labels, play icons...)
- Fixed Alt-Click in Inspectors conflict with Alt-Clicking foldouts.
- Fixed Finder Hierarchy view if the loaded scene asset was deleted.
- Fixed display of errors inside Switch action lists.

## [2.0.0 beta 33] - 2025-07-30

### Added

- Added FloatSwitch action.
- Added GotoState action. Transitions directly to a state without using an event.
- Added support for targeting base Component variables in Get/SetComponentProperty and CallMethod actions, for example, after using GetComponent. When targeting a base Component variable, you also have to specify the expected component type.

## [2.0.0 beta 29] - 2025-07-18

### Big Changes

#### Quick Actions

Shortcut actions are now triggered with *Alt-Click* instead of *Ctrl-Click*.
For example, use *Alt-Click* to quick-add a transition to a state, or quick-add a variable to use in an action.
This was changed to be consistent with other Unity graph tools where Ctrl-Click is used for selection only.

#### Debug FSM Component

Added a debug system that anchors debug info to the screen or GameObjects. 
Add a [Debug FSM](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/components/debug-fsm/) component to debug an FSM.
The system is quite flexible so let us know what other debug components you'd like to see!

#### Markdown Support

Added Markdown support to [PlayMaker Notes](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/components/playmaker-notes/) 
and new [Notes Node](https://hutonggames.com/playmaker/docs/fsm-editor/editor-nodes/) and Note Item in list views. 
Custom Markdown extensions let you link to FSMs, Variables, Events, etc.

#### Node Layout

Improved Node layout rules:

- Regions and Parent States are no longer allowed to overlap nodes outside their bounds.
This visually clarifies state hierarchies, and you spend less time moving regions around to fix overlaps.
- Resizing Regions and Parent States pushes other nodes away to avoid overlaps.
- Moving other nodes over these nodes is not allowed unless holding Alt.
- Hold Alt while dragging to move nodes in and out of Regions and Parent States.
- Copy/Pasting uses the same overlap rules, so other nodes are moved to prevent overlaps.
- Duplicating (*Ctrl-D*) duplicates the nodes inside their respective regions.
(Unlike copying, which collects nodes from different regions.)

### Changed

- Improved handling of layout with regions, substates, and parent states. See above.
- Improved handling of transition links to composite states (can connect to an edge instead of a single point).
- Edit button in FSM Template selector now opens in the same window. Use *Ctrl-Click* to edit in a new window.
- Added hover link arrows to state transition nodes so transition nodes are consistent.
- *Ctrl-Click* to add new actions, events, and variables in respective inspectors.
- Allow "Add Parent" with multiple states selected.
- Better handling of layout with Undo/Redo.

### Added

- *Alt-drag* nodes in and out of regions and states.
- Added transition arrows to State Transitions so all transitions are consistent.
- Added lock state to transition arrows. Click or drag from link arrows to lock the start position. Click the arrow to toggle the lock.
- Added Fit Contents button to resizable node title bar.
- While playing, *Alt-Click* a transition event to send it.
- Added ResetVariableValue and ResetAllVariables actions.
- Added **Reset Variables** setting in FSM Inspector.
- Added Rotation and Tint to Image Widget. NOTE: You may need to manually set Tint to white on saved image nodes.
- Added Mouse samples scenes.

### Fixed

- Fixed finished Regions not re-entering properly when FSM was restarted.
- Fixed an error when deleting a region and using Fit Contents.
- Fixed the drop menu opened for components so it includes Script actions.
- Fixed BehaviourCheckIsEnabled so it can accept constant values.
- Fixed CharacterControllerFall action.

## [2.0.0 beta 28] - 2025-05-19

- Tweaked Start Arrow style.

### Added

- Added InputSystem actions to Addons. Supports 3 main workflows:

  - PlayerInput actions for higher level control.
  - NOTE: Touch actions are WIP.

### Fixed

- Fixed Fsm Info errors with FSM Templates.
- Fixed null ref errors in editor with missing actions (e.g., action was removed or renamed).

## [2.0.0 beta 23] - 2025-01-20

### Changed

- Show multiple loop action error if state has more than one loop action.
- Action Browser: Show action usages as bars instead of numbers.
- Reorganized PlayMaker Project Settings page.

## [2.0.0 beta 22] - 2025-01-15

### Changed

- Added Tag and Layer dropdowns to GameObject actions.
- Component actions can now convert Transform variables in variable selector. The goal is to need less intermediate variables, so if you find a common case please submit an issue.

### Added

- Added SetPosition variants for XY and XYZ.
- Added MemoryGame sample scene.

### Fixed

- Fixed action search not finding the part in parentheses, e.g., Physics Ray Cast (Mouse)
- Fixed warnings when changing Global Event data type.
- Fixed 0,0,0 not registering in Quaternion fields.
- Fixed custom tooltip order in Inspector window.

## [2.0.0 beta 21] - 2024-12-30

### Changed

- Made FSM, Parent State, and Region nodes resizable. Drag borders to resize, use Fit Contents in context menu to auto-size to contents.
- Made links less likely to intersect states. E.g., in a vertical flow, a link back up a chain of states will go around the states instead of through them.
- Removed event colors in Events tab. Too hard to read in some situations.
- DebugFlow no longer records list variable values because it's too expensive. We may add this back as an option.
- Added CanBeNullOrEmpty to Set Text actions (because you can use the action to clear the text).
- Tweaked Start and End arrows. Old versions were more standard, but new versions' meaning should be more obvious.
- Removed Set Scale, Push States and Push Regions Apart context menu items. These were experimental feature not ready for release.
- Work on Invaders and AnimalMatch samples. Invaders is a good example of the new ForEach actions. See FSMs on Invaders GameObject.

### Added

- ForEachListItem and ForEachChild actions. Easier iteration over a list or children of a GameObject in a single state. See Invaders sample for examples.
- Added Apply Styles context menu for states selected in the Graph View. Lets you quickly apply color and icons to multiple states. 
- Exposed Loop Count Limit setting in FSM Inspector. Changed default limit to 50 from 1000. Expensive operations with a high limit could still feel like a crashed editor, so we lowered the limit. But we plan to supplement this method of loop detection with edit time analysis, and elapsed frame time thresholds. Then maybe we can increase the default limit again.
- Added ClampPosition actions.

### Fixed

- Fixed copy/pasting State with substates.
- Fixed list variables sometimes losing values when un-pausing in editor.
- Fixed duplicate Global Variables in Group Inspector.
- Fixed global events icon and color in Graph View.

## [2.0.0 beta 20] - 2024-12-16

### Changed

- Added PlayMaker items to Hierarchy Context Menu.
- Modified TopDownShooter sample to use mouse look.
- Made global transitions groupable in Graph View.
- Moved end node to bottom right to avoid overlaps with links from other states.
- Removed parent state color from global transition border.
- Added slight background tint color to parent states and regions.
- Added Set Parent option to Pool Spawn actions.
- Removed ToString actions. Every type is convertible to string, so we don't need the actions. Use ToString__Format when a type supports numeric formatting. Leave the format empty to use default formatting.
- Moved advanced material actions to addons.

### Added

- Exposed List Count and Is Empty properties in Variable Selector.
- Exposed common PointerEventData properties in Variable Selector.
- Added SendFsmEvent action to send an event to an FSM by name.
- Added Finished Event Never Sent error. Flags Finished transitions that will never trigger because the state has actions that don't finish.
- Added OnVariableValueChanged action to listen for changes in a variable.
- Added BoolInvert and ConvertBoolToSprite actions.
- Added RectTransform Translate, BringToFront, and SendToBack actions.
- Added missing GetComponent actions (in children and parent).
- Added Bounds actions, including GameObjectGetBounds (include children) and GameObjectGetApproximateBounds (cheaper than using GetComponents)
- Added TransformMouseLook2D action, e.g., for topdown shooter games. You can achieve the same thing with 3 low level actions, but our philosophy is to provide a single action for common use cases.
- Added TransformTranslate2D action for convenient use with Vector2 variables.
- Added AnimalMatch drag and drop game sample. (WIP)
- Added Invaders game sample. (WIP)
- Added UI DragImage sample scenes.
- Added UFO test scene to Asteroids sample, to show how to set up quick test scenes with prefabs.

### Fixed

- Fixed record not found errors when editing new prefab FSM.
- Fixed GameObjectAddComponent and GetComponent actions.
- Fixed GroupAssetEditor errors.

## [2.0.0 beta 19] - 2024-12-8

### Changed

- Improved editor performance while playing in the editor, especially when rapidly switching states with Sync enabled. This was a fairly big change so let me know if it broke anything!
- Moved less common ColliderDistance2D, UI, Gradient, and Light property actions to addons
- Removed Touch set actions. It doesn't make a lot of sense to set touch properties. I guess there could be use cases, but it adds noise. We could add them back as an addon if there is demand.
- Formatted Flappy sample to use Device Simulator.

### Added

- More variable property selectors: 
- FloatIsNegative, FloatIsPositive, FloatIsZero, FloatIsNotZero, GameObjectParent, GameObjectName, GameObjectTag, GameObjectPosition2D
- TransformGetLocalScale_XYZ action.
- FlipX and FlipY actions for SpriteRenderer and Transform.
- 2D Platformer sample scenes for Wall Slide and Wall Jump.
- Added Only Actions That Can Finish option to Wait For All Finished action.
- InputSwipeEvent action and sample scene.
- InputTapEvent action, used in Flappy sample scene.
- UI Volume Slider, Drag, and HealthBar sample scenes.
- TopDownShooter sample scenes.

### Fixed

- Fixed glitchy editing of Global Event test data.
- Fixed drag selection consistency in nested states.
- Fixed Direct Link picking.
- Fixed OnBeginDrag event not firing.

## [2.0.0 beta 18] - 2024-12-03

### Changed

- Faster and more reliable scanning of project. No need to save open scenes before scanning. The project database should now update automatically when adding/removing assets and components, editing prefabs, adding scenes, etc. If you find situations where the database is not updated, please submit a bug report.
- Better positioning of Usage Finder windows opened from Used Count labels.
- Moved AnimationClip, AnimationCurve, AnimationEvent, Gradient, AudioClip, and some AudioSource actions to Addons. Those properties are normally set at edit time, but you can import the addons if you need runtime access.

### Added

- Added Scan Project setting to PlayMaker project settings.
- Open PlayMaker Settings in FSM Editor window menu and _Main Menu > Project_.

### Fixed

- List variable initialization (#19)
- List actions not working on Global List Variables (#18)
- Global List Variable not resetting after exiting playmode.
- Null ref error when adding a region (#13)
- Event usages not found in global transitions (#8)
- Addon status not updating after installing an addon (#5)
- GetComponentCount action error in Unity versions below 2022.3.20f1 (#16)
- Grouped assets not appearing in Group Inspector. This was a side effect of the project database not being up to date, specifically after importing a package, like a sample from Addons. The database is now automatically updated after importing a package. If you turn that setting off in PlayMaker project settings then a Scan Project button is shown in the Group Inspector.
- List variable icons occasionally not showing.
- Fixed type selector search (no longer requires exact word matches).
- List item alignment bug (#17)

## [2.0.0 beta 17] - 2024-11-27

**NOTE: This release includes breaking changes. Please install in a fresh project to avoid issues.**

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Event Data is now a single variable instead of a list.
- Reworked List Get Next Item action to use a Current Index and removed the Reset Flag. This is more flexible, letting you share this index with other actions. If you don't supply an index variable the action uses an internal counter.
- Made TMP_Text actions Owner default (#7)

### Added

- **Global Variable Changed Event.** Option to send a Global Event when a Global Variable value changes. Use this to decouple systems. For example, UI FSMs can listen for changes in variables to update the UI instead of you having to send an event to update the UI.
- **Action Debug Info.** Actions can show debug info in action editors; E.g. MoveTowards actions show the current distance. Toggle on/off with the titlebar Debug icon (only shown if the action has debug info)
- **Outputs in FSM Inspector.** You can assign a global variable to store an output value.
- **Variable Properties.** Added Properties category in Variable Selector to select common variable properties. E.g., access Vector3 x, y, z, magnitude or float.absolute directly from the Variable Selector. This should reduce the number of intermediate variables needed for complex operations. For example, you can reference speed.absolute instead of using an action to store the absolute speed. 
- **Get/Set FSM Variable actions.** These actions let you get/set variables in other FSMs. NOTE: These variable usages are currently not found in Finder searches.

### Fixed

- Fixed ListGetNextItem looping and resetting (#4)
- Fixed breadcrumb FSM selection menu when multiple FSMs had the same name (#12)
- Fixed Rigidbody2D Dash action not resetting properly.

## [2.0.0 beta 16] - 2024-11-15

### Added

- Support for fast playmode entering.
- Watch Variable toggle in Variables tab. Shows values in graph view when playing.
- Event buffering. For example, to respond to a jump event sent just before entering the On Ground State. Note, only the Input Button Down Event uses buffering right now. Buffering will be added to more actions. Use Send Buffered Event to send a recently buffered event.
- Use the *Debug &gt; Event Buffer* window to see buffered events.
- TimeCheckElapsedTime action. Checks if a certain amount of time has passed since a recorded time.
- More options for locking link routes in Transition Inspector > Link Settings.

### Changed

- Reworked Platformer sample scenes to make them more flexible and less reliant on custom actions. The idea is that you could experiment with different implementations of move, jump, dash etc. while keeping the states and events the same.
- Cached Animator state and parameter name IDs in Animator actions for better performance.
- Moved less used Animator actions to Addons.

### Fixed

- Fixed Breakpoints (#141).
- Issues pasting transitions with events (#146).
- Error in console when moving assets (#135).
- Switching to State tab when clicking on an already selected state (#142).
- MatchType broken with global list variables (#144).
- Error when stopping scene playback (#140).
- Fixed errors when opening Addons window (#139).
- Fixed setting Default Link Style in PlayMaker settings.
- Fixed ActionBrowser panels overlapping when small.
- Fixed typo in CheckIntLessThanOrEqual action name.
