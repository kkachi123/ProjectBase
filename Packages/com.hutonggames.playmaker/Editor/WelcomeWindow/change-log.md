## [2.0.0 beta 67] - 2026-5-24

- Added [Interactor component](docs:guides/interactables/interactor-component/). Use [InteractorUpdate](action:InteractorUpdate) instead of GameObjectUpdateInteractables (now obsolete).
- Streamlined [Interactable component](docs:guides/interactables/interactable-component/). Added **Inside Trigger** and **Measurement Space** options.
- Added docking setup to [Interactable component](docs:guides/interactables/interactable-component/). Used by [GameObjectDockWithInteractable](action:GameObjectDockWithInteractable) action.
- Added [PlayMaker > Browsers > Interactables](menu:PlayMaker/Browsers/Interactables) to browse all interactable objects in the scene.
- Reworked [First Person Samples](addon:first-person) to use the new Interactor component and actions.

### Changed

- Improved action summary tooltips. Shows parameter name and description.
- Allow selection of compatible variable properties (not just exact types).
- Meter components now set the current value in OnEnable.
- Show regions in the minimap.

### Added

- Added [PlayMaker > Debug > Find Obsolete Actions](menu:PlayMaker/Debug/Find Obsolete Actions) to make it easier to find deprecated actions.
- Added **RowNotFound** policy to DataTable actions like [DataTableGetRowValues](action:DataTableGetRowValues).
- Added constraints to [CharacterControllerClimb](action:CharacterControllerClimb) action.

- Added Enemy scenes to [Top-Down Shooter Samples](addon:top-down-shooter).

### Fixed

- Fixed actions that should be allowed to set null values. E.g., [ImageSetSprite](action:ImageSetSprite).
- Fixed [CharacterControllerClimb](action:CharacterControllerClimb) action so LookDirection respect input direction. Forward moves in look direction, back moves in opposite direction.
- Fixed [CharacterControllerCheckIsGrounded (SphereCast)](action:CharacterControllerCheckIsGrounded__SphereCast) action false positives.
- Fixed Stopwatch meter in [Shooting Gallery Sample](addon:shooting-gallery).

## [2.0.0 beta 66] - 2026-5-8

### Changed

- Improved transition and logging performance. This is actually fairly invasive, so please report any issues you encounter.
- Restored icon, name, and description editing in FSM Inspector.
- Changed [CharacterControllerJump](action:CharacterControllerJump) to output a jump velocity that you then use in "In Air" actions like [CharacterControllerMoveInAir](action:CharacterControllerMoveInAir). This fixes hitches in the hand-off between Jump and other movement actions.
- Tweaked Jump scenes in [First Person Samples](addon:first-person) to better handle falling and ramps.
- Moved Require Raycast Hit from actions to the Interactable component – it's part of the setup of an interactable object.
- Converted ButtonDoor buttons in [First Person Samples](addon:first-person) to use Interactables.
- Only dim PlayMaker hierarchy icon if all FSMs on the GameObject are disabled.

### Added

- Added root canvas menu to make it easier to add a second FSM and select FSMs on a GameObject.
- Added [CharacterControllerMoveOnGround](action:CharacterControllerMoveOnGround) action that applies downward velocity to stick to ramps etc.
- Added [FloatSelectValue](action:FloatSelectValue), [IntegerSelectValue](action:IntegerSelectValue), etc. to select a value based on a Bool. They're conceptually similar to ConvertBoolToFloat etc. but with that emphasis on the target type.
- Added DebugInfo to [PhysicsCheckCollider](action:PhysicsCheckCollider) action.
- Added PressurePlateDoor scene to [First Person Samples](addon:first-person).
- Added logging tools to PlayMaker/Tools. If you have many FSMs updating often, you can disable logging on them to improve performance. The trade-off is the FSM Log and Debug Flow will not work on those FSMs. NOTE: Logging is always off in builds.
- Added a separate Enable Variable History setting in the Debug settings. Recording variable history can be expensive. The trade-off is that you won't see old variable values as you step Prev/Next states using Debug Flow.

### Fixed

- Fixed infinite loop checking in [Loop State](action:LoopState) action with Forever setting.
- Fixed [ListFind](action:ListFind) error with GameObjectList and Name tests.
- Fixed random null ref error when editing prefabs.
- Fixed Global variables losing type information.
